This is the animated background from my Lovely To Do List project, please feel free to check that out as well!
The Lovely To Do List has quite a bit of vanilla Javascript functionality (for what started as a simple small practice project), 
so I stuck with CSS for the background animation. I am sure there are more compact ways to do this with JS and even CSS, but this is how I chose to do it.
I left it easy to change and see the animation parameters for each individual element, instead of going for a few less lines of code. 
I also chose to stick with images rather than svg's and css-created shapes.

I found this nice looking background on Unsplash by Dmytro Tolokonov for my To Do List, but I got the idea in my head to animate it, and so I did.
Using photoshop, the leaves, branches and background were separated into jpg's and png's as appropriate.
Each image was absolute-positioned and the transform origin determined.
Three different animations were created to give more life to the leaves along with different animation delays.
A polygon shape png was also created to match what was already in the photo and used to give some movement to the bottom half of the screen. 
For this I used style variables determined for each image copy in the HTML,
and offset drop shadows were used to add movement without more images. 

A very simple concept and usage of CSS, but also very time consuming.  I've isolated it here to make it easier to use again for other projects.

Enjoy! Thanks Dmytro Tolokonov!
